# NEO7M_Controller

This is a work in progress. Its meant to control the NEO7M GPS.  

The NEO7M can be programmed to produce an accurate clock output from 1 Mhz to 10 Mhz

This program using push buttons to select one of 4 possible stored frequencies in EEPROM.

The push buttons needs better debouncing.
